This is attemt to make a submod for VN2 creating more suitebale ideas, polices and age buffs/objectives.
This submode made for those who will not play VN 2 past renessiance age. This should be like 99% players. So i attemt to remove late game staff like artilery buffs, colonisations or absolutism and add something more interesting in early-mid game.
I also want buff some weak and unpopular ideas like maritime and economy. Becouse of how rare ideas in VN2 i want make each of them strong and decent. I also want rework Ages making em more reasonable.
